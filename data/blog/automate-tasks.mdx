In this blog, we will explore how to automate simple daily tasks with Python, making your workflow faster and error-free.

# Why Automate?

<hr />

Automation saves time, reduces human error, and lets you focus on high-value tasks. With Python’s powerful libraries, automating small repetitive tasks becomes very straightforward.

<br />

# Example 1: Rename Multiple Files

<hr />

Suppose you have a folder with hundreds of files that you want to rename systematically. Here’s how to do it:

```python
import os

folder_path = 'path_to_folder'

for count, filename in enumerate(os.listdir(folder_path)):
    dst = f"file_{str(count)}.jpg"  # rename logic here
    src = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
    dst = os.path.join(folder_path, dst)
    
    os.rename(src, dst)

print("Files renamed successfully.")
````

Replace `path_to_folder` with your directory path. This will rename files as `file_0.jpg`, `file_1.jpg`, etc.

<br />

# Example 2: Sending Emails Automatically

<hr />

You can send automated emails using Python’s `smtplib`. Example:

```python
import smtplib

server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
server.starttls()

server.login('your_email@gmail.com', 'your_password')
server.sendmail('your_email@gmail.com', 'receiver_email@gmail.com', 'This is an automated email from Python.')

server.quit()
```

**Note:** For Gmail, enable *less secure app access* or use *app passwords* for security.

<br />

# Example 3: Convert Multiple Images to PDF

<hr />

Convert all images in a folder into a single PDF file:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

folder = 'images_folder'
images = []

for file in os.listdir(folder):
    if file.endswith('.jpg') or file.endswith('.png'):
        img = Image.open(os.path.join(folder, file)).convert('RGB')
        images.append(img)

images[0].save('output.pdf', save_all=True, append_images=images[1:])
print("PDF created successfully.")
```

Change `'images_folder'` to your folder containing images.

<br />

# Final Thoughts

<hr />

Python automation scripts can simplify your life. Start with **simple file operations and emails**, then move towards **web scraping, API automation, and real-time data pipelines** as your skills grow.
